# VexProjects
This is a folder dedicated to Vex Projects. Hopefully I can grow this to contain both C++ and Python based programs

For right now, the programs here are either block based or Python based. I'd like to improve my coding skills so the more I send commits to these projects, the more I'll learn. Should be fun overcoming these problems!
